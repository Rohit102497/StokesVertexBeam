## Overview
This repository contains implementation codes of all the deep learning models used in the [above paper](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-32-5-7404&id=546969).

## Design
In our paper, we use three below-written experimental designs. For more details, please refer to the paper.
1. **Design 1 -** *Training with only simulation data*: We trained and validated all five deep-learning models using simulated data and tested on the experimental data. 
2. **Design 2 -** *10-fold strategy on experimental data*: We employed a 10-fold strategy to train a ResNet-18 model.
3. **Design 3 -** *Mix Training*:  We train the deep-learning models on mix simulated and experimental data for generalized and robust training.

## Dependencies

## Running the code
To run the models, change the control parameters accordingly in the **main.py** file and run
```
python Code/main.py --design 1
```

### Control Parameters
- `--design`: The type of experiment design. \
          choices = [1, 2, 3] \
          default=3
- `--model_name`: Model to employ \
          choices=["resnet", "alexnet", "vgg", "squeezenet", "densenet", "inception"] \
          default="densenet"
- `--use_pretrained`: Use Pretrained model on ImageNet \
          default="True"
- `--feature_extract`: Flag for feature extracting. When False, we finetune the whole model otherwise we only update the reshaped layer params \
          default="False"
- `--batch_size`: Batch size for training (change depending on how much memory you have).
- `--num_epochs`: Number of epochs to train for.
- `--lr`: Learning rate of the model.
- `--momentum`: momentum of the model.
- `--pretrain_simulated`: If design is 2, then this is a must variable. It is true in case the model need to be pretrain on simulated data otherwise False.

**Note: If design = 2, then make sure to assign `pretrain_simulated` variable**

## Results
The results are saved in the results folder in `.data` format. Please read them to get your prediction results.
